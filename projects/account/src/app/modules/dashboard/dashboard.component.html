                Mycroft's voice assistant software is open source, which means it is free to use and
                the underlying source code is available to the public.  Our entire platform is free
                of advertisements.  The data we collect from those that opt in to our open dataset
                is not sold to anyone.

                For less than one cup of coffee a month, you can help support our server costs,
                hosting, and ongoing development.  All of which all improve Mycroft's performance
                and user experience.
