<!--
Don't display the login page if the URL contains the data returned from a
call to the Tartarus social login endpoint.  When this happens, a view call
will be made to get the tokens and the user will be returned to the previous
window.

This condition is temporary it should be removed when the social login logic
is refactored and moved into Selene.
