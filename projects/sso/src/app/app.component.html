<!--
Don't display the profile page if the URL contains the data returned from a
call to the Tartarus social profile endpoint.  When this happens, a view call
will be made to get the tokens and the user will be returned to the previous
window.

This condition is temporary it should be removed when the social profile logic
is refactored and moved into Selene.
