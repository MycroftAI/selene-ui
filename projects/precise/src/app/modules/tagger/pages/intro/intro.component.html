            Mycroftâ€™s Precise Wake Word Spotter supports multiple different wake words that you
            can choose to activate your Mycroft device. To ensure Precise wake words are trained
            to work well with everyone, audio samples are subjected to classification process we
            call "tagging".  The audio samples are provided by users who have agreed to share their
            data with Mycroft for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="mat-body">
            Wake word tagging enables the Mycroft community to contribute to improving Precise.
            There are multiple characteristics of a sample that help the training process.
            The audible presence of the wake word, the level of background noise and the perceived
            gender of the speaker are examples of these characteristics.
        </p>
        <p class="mat-body">
            To start tagging audio samples, select a wake word below.  A screen containing an audio
            sample and a question will appear.  Play the audio and answer the question to the best
            of your ability.  If you are unsure how to answer skip to the next sample.
