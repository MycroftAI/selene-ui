# How to submit an Issue to a Mycroft repository

When submitting an Issue to a Mycroft repository, please follow these guidelines to help us help you. 

## Be clear about the software, hardware and version you are running

For example: 

* I'm running Chrome version 75.0.3770.142 (see Help > About in most programs)
* Running on a Macbook Pro, OS X v10.15

## Try to provide steps that we can use to replicate the Issue, include URLs

For example: 

1. Register 10  devices
2. Browse to the list of device (https://account.mycroft.ai/devices)
3. Resize the window and notice that the card for the 11th device gets cut off if the window gets too small.  Expected a scrollbar to appear.

## Be as specific as possible about the expected condition, and the deviation from expected condition. 

This is called _object-deviation format_. Specify the object, then the deviation of the object from an expected condition. 


## Upload any files to the Issue that will be useful in helping us to investigate

Please ensure you upload any relevant files - such as screenshots - which will aid us investigating.
